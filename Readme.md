# Unduck Search 

This project provides a prettier and more stylish interface with TailwindCSS that uses `unduck.link` as the search engine.

## What is Unduck?

Unduck is a solution that speeds up DuckDuckGo's bang redirects by doing all the work client-side. Once you've visited `https://unduck.link` once, the JavaScript is cached and won't need to be downloaded again. Your device performs the redirects, not DuckDuckGo's server.

## Search Engine URL

Add the following URL as a custom search engine in your browser:

```
https://unduck.link?q=%s
```

## Why use this project?

Why not? I created this project for fun and to replace Google because I found Unduck to be more practical as a search engine. Plus, who doesn't love a good challenge (for me at least, as a backend dev hehe)?

This project provides a faster and more efficient search interface using DuckDuckGo's bangs, but with the improved speed of Unduck and a stylish interface with TailwindCSS. And let's be honest, we all love a good-looking interface.

## Service Worker (sw.js)

The service worker (sw.js) is used to cache the necessary files so that the search interface loads quickly and smoothly. Pretty neat, right?

## Dark Theme

The dark theme is always the first priority because, let's face it, the community of people who follow Theo are usually from the tech sector (correct me if I'm wrong!), and they generally prefer dark themes. It's like an unwritten rule or something. Plus, it just looks cooler.

## How to Use

Using this search engine is just like using Google, but with the added power of DuckDuckGo's bangs. Simply type your search query in the search bar and hit enter. You can use bangs to quickly search specific sites (e.g., `!w` for Wikipedia, `!yt` for YouTube, and last but not least, `!t3` for t3.chat!).
